# Major Refactor One

## Introduction
Date: April 15, 2025
<br>
Name: Dustin, only developer
<br>
After asking for help on the Python discord in game development,
a helpful member taught me some Python testing code and gave me an overview
of his honest suggestions to refactor my code.

[His advice is listed here.](./advice_1.md)

## Plan for Near Future
1. Re-read codebase and rubber duck
2. Implement the changes I've been mentally hashing:
    - ChessGame, Board, GameState, Board.board, Board.players
3. Learn Python Testing.
    - familiarize with circular import problems
4. Implement 'Play' mode and 'Replay' mode successfully
